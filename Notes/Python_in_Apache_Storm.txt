pystorm:

Pystorm lets you run Python code against real-time streams of data via Apache Storm. With pystorm you can create Storm bolts and spouts in Python without having to write a single line of Java.
It is meant to be used under-the-hood by Storm Python libraries that will provide the command-line tools for actually building/submitting the topologies (e.g., streamparse).
