ML Part in Folder Code in Python
Storm Topology in Folder DistributedStreamJoinML in Java

Parameters:
Parameters have to be set in the Topology AND in the Python implementation.
The number of training episodes, clustering type and parallelism have to be set in ClustererBolt.py.
The parallelism also has to be changed in the StormPartitioning.py (where the input for the ANN has to be adapted).
The parameters should be set according to the performance capabilities of the machines. (If a GPU is installed the number of training episodes should be set higher etc.)
I tried to make setting the parameters simpler but it caused many issues. In general, the split of Java/Python is a source of many issues.

Further possible improvements:
New clustering algorithms can be easily implemented in StormClustering.py. If the algorithm requires an affinity matrix instead of a distance matrix the implementation has to be changed slightly (see Approach Chapter in the Thesis). 
The JoinerBolt is the part with the most optimization potential, where the implementation is very simple currently.
